Automation codes for workflow in the combustion lab

1. Make workspace for position.py (preferably an open directory on HPCC)
2. Make positions start from 0.1 on unit cell (0.1,0,0) relative to chlorine atom or whatever polyatomic ion in question (doesnt matter)...)
3. make sure when running position.py, you need to make sure that the atoms dont penetrate the unitcell walls.
4. once you have this done, run positon.py with templates and make run directory in scratch
5. PATH=/usr/bin execdir...
6. wait and enjoy!
